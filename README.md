# ManiExpenditure
A simple Qt desktop application for keeping track of my non-routine expenditure.

* This simple application helps me record how much money I spend on an item and calculate the average monthly cost during the expected duration of usage.
* For example, I bought a laptop in Jan 2018 with $900 and expect to use it for 5 years. This counts for an expenditure of $15 per month during Jan 2018 - Dec 2022.
